# PREZZOTIMER ⏰ 🤔
# 

This project is for people who give presentations with lots of slides and want to avoid running overtime.

This python app shows you the target slide number which you can compare to the actual slide number so you can speed up or slow down your presentation.

## My problem:
I believe in the concept of [one-idea-per-slide](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qKDvUO-hK5s). I run a [workshop](https://lu.ma/nascent) where I present ~250 slides over 2 hours, interspersed with lots of audience participation. So it's easy for the workshop to run long, but I want to respect my audience's time and keep to the planned 2 hours. So far, I've been [keeping time by manually](IMG_0532.jpeg) writing out a table of time on the clock and target slide number, which I then compare to the current slide. This is tedious and distracts from the preso. 

I wanna build "an app for that".


## Solution: Prezzotimer app 
Input values: 
  - Presentation duration (e.g., 2 hours)
  - Total slides (e.g., 250) 
  - Start time (e.g., 2.30pm) since I'll launch this app 10 to 20 mins before I begin presenting.
 
Output: 
  - A timer that counts 1->250 over 2 hours so I can compare the slide timer with the current slide.
  - The timer should be large (full screen) when I'm giving an in-person workshop and small (ideally in the Menu Bar) for on-line webinars. 

Future development: I use Google Presentations so I could try to link this app to gPreso so it would automatically see which slide I'm on and provide more useful feedback.


Assume: [screen extension, not display mirroring](Mac-External-Displays-Arrangment.jpg) during in-person workshops.


## Details

- Smart time input: Accepts start times in many formats, including '2pm', '2:30pm', '14:00', '1400', '2.20', and '14.20'.
- Defaults for rapid setup: During development, the slides and duration fields autopopulate with 100 and 10, respectively.
- Buffer field: Specify a buffer (default 10 minutes) to end the timer early and leave time for Q&A or wrap-up.
- Waiting screen: If the start time is in the future, the app displays a clear waiting message, current time, and a countdown until the presentation begins.
- User-friendly time display: All times are shown in 12-hour am/pm format for clarity.
- Input validation: The app checks for valid numbers and ensures the buffer is less than the total duration.
- Modular, refactored code: Timer logic and time parsing are separated for easier maintenance and future improvements.
